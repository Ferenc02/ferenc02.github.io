				This script offers an incredible glimpse into the world of elementary cellular automata, a
				concept introduced by Stephen Wolfram. Cellular automata are not just an abstract
				computational model—they occur naturally in patterns seen in nature, such as the growth of
				corals, shell patterns, and even some chemical reactions. The beauty of this script lies in
				its ability to simulate such phenomena using simple rules, which govern the state of each
				cell based on its neighbors. Wolfram's work categorized all possible behaviors of cellular
				automata into 256 unique rules, each producing distinct and often mesmerizing patterns. For
				example, Rule 126 (the default in this script) creates structured, yet chaotic, evolutions.
				These patterns reveal how complex structures can emerge from basic, deterministic rules,
				offering profound insights into both computational theory and natural systems. You can
				adjust the rule and cell width to see how different patterns emerge. All the 256 rules are
				explained in detail on Wolfram's official site:
