The tree's branches are created by repeatedly dividing the main trunk into smaller segments, resulting in a visually striking pattern that mimics the natural growth of trees. Built with p5.js, the project allows you to interactively adjust the tree's parameters, exploring the beauty of fractal structures."

				This script generates fractal trees, a stunning representation of recursive geometry found
				in nature. Fractal trees are created through a recursive process, where each branch splits
				into smaller branches, forming a complex structure. The beauty of these trees lies in their
				self-similar patterns, which are evident at every scale of the tree's growth. As the
				branches grow and split, they mimic the branching structures seen in nature, such as trees,
				blood vessels, and even lightning bolts. Fractals in nature optimize space and resources, as
				seen in the way plants and trees distribute branches to maximize sunlight capture. This
				recursive structure is also present in phenomena like river systems, the branching of
				neurons, and the formation of coral reefs, all of which rely on fractal geometry to enhance
				efficiency and resilience. This fractal tree was coded with p5.js, using Perlin noise to
				generate the length and position of each tree for a more natural-looking forest generation.
				By incorporating Perlin noise, the trees are positioned in random, yet smooth patterns,
				creating a more organic feel and avoiding rigid, uniform placements. Read more about fractal
				trees and patterns in nature:
