        This script generates fractal trees, a stunning representation of
        recursive geometry found in nature. Fractal trees are created through a
        recursive process, where each branch splits into smaller branches,
        forming a complex structure. The beauty of these trees lies in their
        self-similar patterns, which are evident at every scale of the tree's
        growth. As the branches grow and split, they mimic the branching
        structures seen in nature, such as trees, blood vessels, and even
        lightning bolts. Fractals in nature optimize space and resources, as
        seen in the way plants and trees distribute branches to maximize
        sunlight capture. This recursive structure is also present in phenomena
        like river systems, the branching of neurons, and the formation of coral
        reefs, all of which rely on fractal geometry to enhance efficiency and
        resilience. This fractal tree was coded with p5.js, using Perlin noise
        to generate the length and position of each tree for a more
        natural-looking forest generation. By incorporating Perlin noise, the
        trees are positioned in random, yet smooth patterns, creating a more
        organic feel and avoiding rigid, uniform placements. Read more about
        fractal trees and patterns in nature:
